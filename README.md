## Development prerequisites

- [Go 1.25+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Wails CLI](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && pnpm install && cd ..

# Run in development mode (hot reload)
wails dev

# Build for production
wails build
```

## Quality Checks

```bash
# Run full pre-push checks manually (backend + frontend)
pwsh -File ./scripts/pre-push-check.ps1

# Optional: enforce checks automatically before every git push
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The pre-push check includes:
- `gofmt` validation for all tracked Go files
- `go test ./...`
- `go test` coverage gate (`scripts/check-go-coverage.ps1`, default minimum: `45%`)
- frontend `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run format:check`, and `pnpm run test`

## How It Works

1. **Registry** — Railyard clones a Git-based registry of available maps and mods.
2. **Installation** — Maps are downloaded as zip archives containing PMTiles, config, and GeoJSON data files. These are extracted to the Railyard data directory.
3. **Mod Generation** — At game launch, Railyard generates a Subway Builder mod (`com.railyard.maploader`) that registers all installed maps with the game's modding API.
4. **Tile Serving** — A local PMTiles server starts on a random port to serve vector tiles to the game at runtime.
5. **Thumbnails** — SVG thumbnails are generated from water layer features in the map's vector tiles and cached for display in the UI.
